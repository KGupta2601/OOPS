# Object in Java

An **object** is a real-time entity that possesses both state and behavior. In Java, an object is an instance of a class, which contains instance variables representing the object's state and methods defining its behavior. Objects are created using the `new` keyword in Java.

## Definitions of an Object

1. An object is a **real-world entity**.
2. An object is a **runtime entity**.
3. An object is an entity that has **state** and **behavior**.
4. An object is an **instance of a class**.

## Characteristics of Objects

- **State**: The attributes or properties of an object, such as color, size, and name.
- **Behavior**: The methods or functions that define what the object can do, such as move, draw, or calculate.
- **Identity**: A unique identifier for the object, allowing it to interact with other objects.

## Real-World Examples

- **Dogs**: A dog has state attributes like name, color, breed, and hunger level, and behaviors such as barking, fetching, and wagging its tail.
- Other examples include: Chair, Bike, Marker, Pen, Table, Car, Book, Apple, Bag. Objects can be physical (tangible) or logical (intangible).

In summary, objects are fundamental building blocks in Java programming that encapsulate both data (state) and behavior (methods), allowing developers to model real-world entities effectively.
